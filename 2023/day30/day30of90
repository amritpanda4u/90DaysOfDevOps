K8S architecture:

Kubernetes cluster comprises of two important components Master and nodes. 
Master consits of APIServer, scheduller, controll manager and etcd.
APIServer - It is the entry point to the nodes. It accepts the command from the user by kubectl and passes to the differnt components of master.
Scheduller - It schedules the deployment of pods as per the instruction received from API server.
Control manger - Keeps the control of teh pods running in the nodes.
etcd - it is the database which keeps the record of all the nodes/pods and acordingly sends the status to control manager.

Kubectl - it is the cli that the user uses to send command to API Server
Kubelet - It exiists inside all the nodes and receives the command from API server.
